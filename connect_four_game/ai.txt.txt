Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
	Yes, I make two methods to deal with the AI's defensive and offensive moves.
	The first method is called computer_AI_3 to check if there is a move to make the player or AI win.
	it will select defensive or offensive moves
	The second method is called computer_AI_2 running after the first move if there is no further risk if ai to losing the game.
	Ai will develop its own moves to win the game or keep make defensive

If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
	I did a lot of testing and debugging. I was very pleased with the performance of the AI

How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
	First of all, Ai will make a defensive move if there is no other AI disk
	then, It will check is there a consecutive three disk on a row or consecutive three disks on a column
		if so, AI will win the game
	if not, It will check is there a consecutive three disk on a row or consecutive three disks on a column
		if consecutive three disks on a column, AI will defensive
		if consecutive three disks on a row
			Ai will check if there is a blocked disk on either side, then
			Ai will defensive
			it will check the disk is valid before, in other words, the disk will dropping to the same row.
	AI also know how to block the middle position of contiguous rows to be formed
		if the first, the second, and the fourth player disk of a row are formed, AI will drop the third empty seat
	If there is no further move to decided to victory
		AI will check all two consecutive disk on a row or column, and AI will defend
	if there is no further two consecutive disk
		Ai will check if AI has two consecutive disk opportunity to expand the advantage
		Ai will make an offensive move
	if there is no opportunity for AI offensive
		Ai will find create a random choice

How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
	The AI  beats me very often if I play carelessly. I give to my friends and they won't beat AI as well.
	However, since I creat this logic I know the flaws of this AI 
	I can take advantage of diagonal lines to defeat the AI (AI can't deal with diagonal)

How would you improve it in the future?
	I could add the ability to AI handle diagonals. all the architecture has been written 
	and it just needed to keep adding functionality in the method
